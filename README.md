# Lizify

Give your images a touch of class with Liz. 

Built in 10 minutes thanks to [OpenCV](http://opencv.org), [Faced](https://github.com/gordalina/faced) and [node-canvas](https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas).

## Example

```js
var lizify = require('lizify');

lizify('./input.jpg', './output.jpg', function(err) {
    console.log('More liz added.');
});
```

## What... Why..?

_I needed something that messed with images for a demonstration of something else and only on Github so I can have a npm git dependency._

_I'm sorry._

## Installation from npm?

No.
